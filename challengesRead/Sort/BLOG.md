# Sorting Algorithms

- In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. 

# Insertion(Selection) Sort
Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times finding the ascending/descending order.

# Challenge Summary

divide and conquer
best case, O(n log n)  n steps to partition the array, log n times.
worse O(n^2)
Since, it only swaps elements within the array, it uses O(1) space.
