# 15. Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A tree is a nonlinear data structure,  
and here the basic functionality of Binary Trees, and Binary Search Trees using java is covered.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- **We asked to Create 3 classes :**
1. **Node class**
2. **Binary Tree class**, with pre-order, in-order, and post-order methods.
3. **Binary Search Tree class**, with **Add** and **contains** methods.
  
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
### 1. Binary Trees
- The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node and Searching <- is O(n).

- The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree.

### 2. Binary Search Trees
- The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Treeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height). 

- The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1).

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
- In **Binary Tree** class we have 3 traversals methods, return an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
1. pre order
2. in order
3. post order. 


- In **Binary Search Tree** class we have 2 methods:
1. **Add**  
Arguments: value  
Return: nothing  
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
     
2. **Contains**  
Argument: value  
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

# 16. Tree Max


# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
We asked to write a method that finds the maximum numeric value stored in the binary tree. 
- Method: **findMaximumValue()**
- Arguments: none
- Returns: number

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
![TreeMax](../challenges/tree/app/src/main/resources/tgitreeMax.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(n) because it checks the value for each node.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- Initilize A tree variable from **BinaryTree Class**.
- then call the **findMaximumValue()** method.
