# 35. Graph
A graph is data structure consisting of data that is stored among many groups of edges and vertices. 

## Challenge
- **We asked to implement Graph by Creating 2 classes with their basic methods:**
1. **Vertex class**
2. **Graph Class**

## [Link to the test](../challenges/graph/app/src/test/java/graph/GraphTest.java)

## Approach & Efficiency
1. **addNode** mehod ->
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Time Complexity: O(1)

2. **addEdge** mehod -> 
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Time Complexity: O(1)

3. **getNodes** method -> 
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Time Complexity: O(1)

4. **getNeighbors** method ->
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Time Complexity: O(1)

5. **size** method -> 
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Time Complexity: O(1)



## API
### Graph Class Methods:
1.  **addNode(String value)** ->  Add a node to the graph and returns the added node value.
2.  **addEdge(String data1, String data2)** -> Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph.
3. **getNodes()** -> returns all the nodes in the graph as a set collection.
4. **getNeighbors()** -> Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node.
5. **size()** -> Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
